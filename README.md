# gutenberg-script

Script to pull all english gutenberg files. It downloads, organizes, removes duplicates, and converts the txt files to pdf. 

You'll need pandoc but I just did ``` brew install pandoc ``` and that seemed to work for me. 

Only problem is that it doesn't work all at once because I'm not used to bash scripting and don't know how to make it go w/o errors. will fix.
